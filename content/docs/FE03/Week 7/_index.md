# Week 7 – React Project

This week is focused on preparing for your first **advanced React project**. The emphasis is on idea generation, evaluation, and getting mentor feedback before you begin building.

**Step 1 — Ideation (within 24 hours)**  
Think of **five strong, meaningful project ideas**. Refine each idea with a short description, target users, and the core problem it solves. Share these ideas with your mentors and gather feedback to decide which one to pursue.

**Step 2 — Planning & Execution**  
Once your mentors help you finalise one idea:
- Create a clear plan for the project (features, pages, components, APIs, data flow, etc.).
- Build the project over the next few days and deploy it.
- Make the project **as polished and production-ready as possible**.
- Use and demonstrate all the concepts you’ve learned so far—React, TypeScript, routing, state management, hooks, performance optimisations, API handling, UI/UX best practices, etc.
