# Week 2 to 5 – Namaste React with TypeScript

Over the next month, you will dive deep into React and strengthen your frontend fundamentals by completing the **Namaste React** course. Your focus will be on building a strong understanding of React’s core concepts while applying everything hands-on.

**Guidelines**

- Set up all projects using **Vite** instead of Create React App.
- Write **every single file** in **TypeScript**. JavaScript is not allowed.
- Commit **every small change** to GitHub — treat this as documentation of your learning journey.
- Whenever you learn a new concept, **implement it immediately** in a small example or project. Practice reinforces theory.
