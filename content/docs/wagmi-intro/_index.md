# What is WAGMI?

Welcome to WAGMI, an initiative founded by Yash, Aman, and Dilsha Mam three years ago with the mission to help our juniors become exceptional engineers. WAGMI, which stands for "We are all gonna make it," is a phrase popularized in the crypto community, symbolizing collective success and perseverance. Over the past three years, we have mentored more than 20 students, igniting their passion for engineering and computer science. Until now, WAGMI has operated as an underground project, allowing us to refine our approach and plan for future expansion. Rest assured, WAGMI is not a commercial venture; we have no intention of monetizing it. Our sole purpose is to cultivate a genuine interest in computer science and guide students toward a successful career path.
