# WAGMI Syllabus

Welcome to the official syllabus for the WAGMI program, 2025 batch. This structured curriculum is designed to build you into a solid, job-ready developer by combining technical depth, discipline, and a strong sense of community.

The course will follow a strict module-based order. Each module has its own code and will be taught sequentially:

- `ds01`: Data Structures and Algorithms
- `fe01`: Frontend Engineering Fundamentals
- `cs01`: Core Computer Science Concepts
- …and so on as the syllabus progresses.

You’ll find all topics listed in the **left sidebar**. Each item leads you directly to the relevant section, so navigate freely and dive deep into each topic.

We strongly encourage you to reach out to mentors whenever you feel stuck, confused, curious, or even inspired. Whether it’s technical help or general career guidance—**nothing is off-limits**. Talk to them. That’s what they’re here for.

## Guidelines for Success

To get the most out of this program:

- **Be on time**: Sessions and deadlines are not flexible.
- **Stick to the structure**: Jumping around will only hurt your progress.
- **Ask for help**: Don’t sit on doubts—discuss them early.
- **Show up and do the work**: This course rewards consistency.

We’ve designed this curriculum to be tough but fair. If you follow the system, stay sharp, and put in the effort, **you’ll be unstoppable**.

Let’s get started.
