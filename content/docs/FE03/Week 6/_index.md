# Week 6 – Advanced JavaScript (Namaste JS S1 & S2)

This week is dedicated to strengthening your JavaScript fundamentals at an advanced level. Before moving further in React and TypeScript, it’s important to deeply understand how JavaScript behaves under the hood.

You will study **Namaste JavaScript Season 1 & Season 2**, starting from **Advanced (Video 10 onwards)**. Focus on understanding the concepts, not just watching the videos.
