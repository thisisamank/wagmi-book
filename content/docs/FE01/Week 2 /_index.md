# Week 2 ‚Äì JavaScript Basics

In Week 2 of `FE01`, we‚Äôll get started with the JavaScript language and explore how browsers actually work under the hood. We‚Äôll also go deeper into CSS selectors and pseudo-elements.

‚Üí **Suggestion**: Don‚Äôt rush. Take time to understand the logic behind each concept. Try to write small JavaScript programs to reinforce the learning.
